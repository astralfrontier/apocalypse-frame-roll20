**APOCALYPSE FRAME Sheet**

Made by Astral Frontier, with some help by Binary Star Games, for [APOCALYPSE FRAME](https://binarystar.games/apocalypse-frame-itch-r/)!

**Autofilling**: 

- Just put in your favorite Frame and it'll auto-populate! It has data for all non-Advanced Frames in the core book.
- Likewise with Armaments and Systems, just start typing. (Do Frame first though, it populates defaults.)
- Maximum resources will be set automatically when you set Attributes. Current resources are dependent on the number of boxes checked.
- If you add more tags to the listing, it'll display them as well.
